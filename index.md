Welcome to my homepage! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher on Meta’s [Central Applied Science Team](https://research.facebook.com/teams/cas/), where I focus on forecasting—developing innovative solutions and scalable tools to tackle real-world challenges efficiently. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from North Carolina State University, where I was advised by Prof. [Sujit Ghosh](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~ghosh/). My research interests span time series forecasting, machine learning, and optimization. 

At Meta, I focus on central revenue forecasting—building system that support critical decisions across the company. Previously, during my Ph.D., I developed zeroth-order optimization algorithms for complex black-box problems.

Broadly, I aim to bridge academic research and real-world impact by creating useful, robust, generalizable, and innovative systems.
