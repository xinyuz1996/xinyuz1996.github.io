Welcome to my homepage! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher on Meta’s [Central Applied Science Team](https://research.facebook.com/teams/cas/), where I focus on forecasting—developing innovative solutions and scalable tools to tackle real-world challenges efficiently.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from North Carolina State University, advised by Prof. [Sujit Ghosh](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~ghosh/). 

My research interests span time series forecasting, machine learning, and optimization. I work on enhancing the forecasting performance using ML techniques, with applications in areas such as financial markets. At Meta, I work on enhancing revenue forecasting systems by building scalable, accurate, and data-efficient models that support critical business decisions. 

More broadly, my work aims to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world impact by designing scalable systems—such as central revenue forecasting models—that are robust, generalizable, and practically useful.
