Welcome to my homepage! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher on Metaâ€™s [Central Applied Science Team](https://research.facebook.com/teams/cas/), where my research centers on forecasting, providing innovative solution and efficient tooling to solve practical problems with forecasting.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from North Carolina State University, advised by Prof. [Sujit Ghosh](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~ghosh/).

My research interests span time series forecasting, machine learning, and optimization. I focus on improving the performance of forecasting models through advanced machine learning techniques, with applications in financial markets and epidemiological disease control. Additionally, I work on developing efficient zeroth-order global optimization algorithms to tackle challenging black-box problems.
